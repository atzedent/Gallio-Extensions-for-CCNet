In order to answer Brendan Rice's question 
("http://groups.google.com/group/ccnet-user/browse_thread/thread/5717d9e8b465b3a0?hl=en":http://groups.google.com/group/ccnet-user/browse_thread/thread/5717d9e8b465b3a0?hl=en).

I had the same problem and so decided to branch that specific part of the Gallio sources.

In particular I modified GallioAttachmentBuildAction.cs at line 53:

"origin":http://code.google.com/p/mb-unit/source/browse/branches/v3.1/src/Extensions/CCNet/CCNet.Gallio.WebDashboard.Plugin/GallioAttachmentBuildAction.cs:

@Build build = buildRetriever.GetBuild(cruiseRequest.BuildSpecifier);@

modification:

@Build build = buildRetriever.GetBuild(cruiseRequest.BuildSpecifier, cruiseRequest.RetrieveSessionToken());@   
                     

and GallioAttachmentBuildPlugin.cs line 51:

"origin":http://code.google.com/p/mb-unit/source/browse/branches/v3.1/src/Extensions/CCNet/CCNet.Gallio.WebDashboard.Plugin/GallioAttachmentBuildPlugin.cs:

@get { throw new NotSupportedException(); }@

modification:

@get { return "Gallio Attachment Build Plugin"; }@
            
and exchanged the libs
- NetReflector.dll
- ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Core.dll
- ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.dll
with the latest of CruiseControl.NET-1.5.0.6237.

In the Downloads section you will find the compiled CCNet.Gallio.WebDashboard.Plugin.dll which has to be copied to the 
'WebDashboard\bin\' directory of CCNet.
